    "\n",
    "Billboard Magazine's \"Hot 100\" has been the barometer for what the most popular music in the coutry is for decades, making it a readily available measurement of \"what we like\" in music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Billboard's methodology has always included a combination of radio play and sales but over time the way these things were defined and collected changed which begs the question:\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the basis of measurement for what we like changes over time, then before we can consider the impact of the qualities of specific entries (e.g. artist gender, song genre, duration, seasonality, etc.) we need to consider the impact of the system itself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The initial question for this assignment was about the songs most popular in 2000 so my initial focus was on the impact of changes made in December of 1998:\n",
    "    - Additional radio formats, including R&B, mainstream rock, AAA, and country, were added to data collection\n",
    "    - Weighting of sales in the calculation was cut from 40% to 25%\n",
    "    - Songs unavailable for sale as singles would now be included.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This last item might sound like a throw-away, but record labels had taken to distributing songs to radio stations and not put them up for sale until after they had gotten very popular. The song would then debut on the Hot 100 very high in the ranks, if not at #1, after which they would decline quickly since listener fatigue would already have set in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically these changes should have resulted in a decrease in the average debut rank and a lengthening of the duration of songs on the charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the scope of this paper is on the potential impact of methodological changes on the chart from a high level, it should be noted that individual entries could be outliers, skewing the data.\n",
    "\n",
